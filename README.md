Graph processing is of increasing interest for many scientific areas and revenue-generating applications, such as social networking, bioinformatics, online retail, and online gaming. To address the growing diversity of graph datasets and graph-processing algorithms, developers and system integrators have created a large variety of graph-processing platforms, which we define as the combined hardware, software, and programming system that is being used to complete a graph processing task. **LDBC Graphalytics**, an industrial-grade benchmark under [LDBC](http://ldbcouncil.org), is developed to enable objective comparisons between graph processing platforms by using six representative graph algorithms, and a large variety of real-world and synthetic datasets. Visit [our website](https://atlarge-research.com/projects/graphalytics) (to be launched) for the most recent updates of the Graphalytics project.

## Run first benchmark
Graphalytics provides [a list of platform drivers](https://atlarge-research.com/projects/graphalytics/platforms) (to be launched) for the state-of-the-arts graph processing platforms. To start your first benchmark with Graphalytics, download the benchmark softwares from our repository and follow the detailed instructions in the manual on [Running Benchmark](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics/wiki/Manual:-Running-Benchmark).


## Add your platform
Do you want to study and compare the performance of your newly developed platform? The Graphalytics benchmark suite can be easily extended by developed a platform driver for your own platform, built upon the platform driver template. Follow the detailed instructions in the manual on [Implementing Driver](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics/wiki/Manual:-Implementing-Driver).

## Participate in competitions
LDBC Graphalytics hosts bi-annual competitions for graph processing platforms. Interested in the state-of-the-art performance? View the competition results of previous editions in [our website](https://atlarge-research.com/projects/graphalytics/competition) (to be launched). Do you want to impress others with the excellent performance of your platform? Follow the detailed instructions in the manual on [Submitting Results](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics/wiki/Manual%3A-Submitting-Result).
