For graph-processing, we have evaluated 6 platforms (Hadoop, YARN, Stratosphere, Giraph, GraphLab, and Neo4j) of 5 algorithms (STATS, BFS, CONN, CD, and EVO). This is the source code of the algorithms we have implemented for each platforms. This source code includes all the core part of the algorithms. Note that YARN has the same source code of Hadoop, because it can seamlessly support old MapReduce jobs. If you have any question about this code, please contact us.

The following are the packages that we are used:

For Hadoop:
- Hadoop
- log4j

For YARN:
- YARN
- log4j

For Stratosphere:
- Stratosphere
- log4j
- Hadoop-HDFS

For Giraph:
- Giraph
- log4j
- guava-libraries 
- Hadoop

For GraphLab:
- GraphLab
- Hadoop-HDFS

For Neo4j:
- Neo4j
- log4j
